	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p>Little boy. Having an okay time! I want a space to write that someone <i>could</i> find but probably no one will ever see. A nice little personal website to find late at night when you're panning for that delightful golden buzz we all get from the JOY OF DISCOVERY. I hope this gives someone a little spark of happiness! God knows we need it! LOVE YOU!!!</p>
